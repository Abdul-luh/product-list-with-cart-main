### What I learned

I tried learning useReducer but this project made me get a hang of it and it is what I used to handle all my cart items

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```tsx
// created the state
const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState<Record<string, number>>({});
```

```tsx
// Calculate total items in cart
const totalItems = Object.values(cartItems).reduce(
  (sum, quantity) => sum + quantity,
  0
);
```

and handled most things from that knowledge

```tsx
// components/OrderTotal.tsx
type OrderTotalProps = {
  cartItems: Record<string, number>;
  desserts: { name: string; price: number }[];
};

export default function OrderTotal({ cartItems, desserts }: OrderTotalProps) {
  const total = Object.entries(cartItems).reduce((sum, [name, quantity]) => {
    const dessert = desserts.find((d) => d.name === name);
    return dessert ? sum + dessert.price * quantity : sum;
  }, 0);

  return (
    <div className="flex justify-between items-center mt-4 pt-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-lg text-rose-900">Order Total</span>
      <span className="font-bold text-lg text-rose-900">
        ${total.toFixed(2)}
      </span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

created font variable from the available font in the starter file

```css
font-face {
  font-family: "RedHatText";
  src: url("/fonts/static/RedHatText-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}
@font-face {
  font-family: "RedHatText";
  src: url("/fonts/static/RedHatText-SemiBold.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 600;
  font-style: normal;
}
/* ... */
```

used the tailwinds latest method of setting up variables

```css
@theme {
  /* Custom font */
  --font-redhat: "RedHatText", sans-serif;

  /* Custom Solid Colors */
  --color-red: hsl(14, 86%, 42%);
  --color-green: hsl(159, 69%, 38%);

  /* Rose Scale */
  --color-rose-50: hsl(20, 50%, 98%);
  --color-rose-100: hsl(13, 31%, 94%);
  --color-rose-300: hsl(14, 25%, 72%);
  --color-rose-400: hsl(7, 20%, 60%);
  --color-rose-500: hsl(12, 20%, 44%);
  --color-rose-900: hsl(14, 65%, 9%);
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I would like to build more UI's with animation, working with actual backend a sending and retrieving data from backend, building realtime data applications and online payment application, but most of all, know how the professional work really is and make something that solves problems

### Useful resources

- [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/) - This helped me explain some concepts I never really understood. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [DeepSeek AI](https://chat.deepseek.com/) - This is an amazing AI tool which helped me finally understand useRducer and compartmentalization of components. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
